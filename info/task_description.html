<p>
You are planning the train schedule and you want to know the minimum time between the stations.
</p>
<p>
Each section of the rail between stations is given in the {% if interpreter.slug == "js-node" %}Array{% else %}list{% endif %}.
Each section is a tuple of distance and speed limit (both are integers).
You can change the speed ( +1. -1 and &plusmn; 0 ) at the start and every minute after that.
The train runs by the same amount as the speed value in a minute.
<br>
Note: This means that a train with a speed of 2 will travel a distanse of 2 before another minute passes and its speed can be changed again.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Starting speed is 0.</li>
    <li>Speed limit is set for each section of the rail.
        You don't exceed it.</li>
    <li>You must reach the target station at speed 1 (because it’s necessary to stop at the station).
</ul>

<p>
You should return the minimum time (minutes) as an integer.

<p><strong>Input: </strong>
{% if interpreter.slug == "js-node" %}
Array of the section of the rail. Each section is an array of distance (as an integer) and speed limit (as an integer). 
{% else %}
List of the section of the rail. Each section is a tuple of distance (as an integer) and speed limit (as an integer). 
{% endif %}

<p><strong>Output: </strong>The minimum time (minutes) as an integer.
</p>


<p>
<strong>How it is used:</strong><br>
For efficient acceleration and deceleration.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Precondition:</strong><br>
<ul>
    <li>distance &gt; 0</li>
    <li>speed limit &gt; 0</li>
    <li>len(section) &gt; 0</li>
